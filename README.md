# Server
The server side application has two main parts:

- Parsing the command from the TCP stream and writing response to the TCP socket
- Making the appropriate state mutation, most likely on a HashMap

The majority fo the server logic has already been implemented once while reading through the mini-redis tutorial, so there is not much to cover on the server side.
